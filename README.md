# Cee4ev Calculator

This repository hosts the code for a simple energy cost calculator website for an electric vehicle (EV) charging station. This project showcases how AI, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, can assist in developing and deploying a fully functional web application at zero cost.

## Project Overview

The website includes a calculator that computes the charge for each customer based on their usage and whether they're a member or not. It provides an interactive interface for users to input their phone number and usage data. Furthermore, it generates a print-friendly receipt detailing the transaction.

## The Power of AI: GPT-4 at Work

This project wouldn't have been possible without the assistance of OpenAI's GPT-4. As a language model, GPT-4 helped generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code needed to create an interactive and user-friendly website. The AI also provided insights into the basic structure and functions of coding, offering a practical learning experience.

Moreover, GPT-4 demonstrated the power of combining AI functionality with the shared wisdom of the global developer community. The website's sleek and modern styling was inspired by a design shared by Soufiane Khalfaoui Hassani on Codepen, which you can check out [here](https://codepen.io/soufiane-khalfaoui-hassani/pen/LYpPWda). This project is a testament to how AI can not only assist in coding but also in integrating and leveraging shared resources effectively.

## Features

- **User Input and Calculations**: The website accepts user inputs and performs computations to determine the cost of charging.
- **Receipt Printing**: The website has a feature that allows users to print a receipt of their transaction.
- **Data Storage**: We use Google Sheets as a simple database to store each transaction's phone number and charge details.
- **Timestamps**: Each transaction is timestamped in our makeshift database.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the front-end of the website.
- Google Apps Script: To use Google Sheets as a simple database.

## How to Use

1. Enter your phone number.
2. Input the kWh displayed on the charger.
3. Click 'Print' to print a receipt of the transaction.
